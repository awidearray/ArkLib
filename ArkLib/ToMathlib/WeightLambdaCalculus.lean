# $\Lambda$-Weight Calculus on the Ring of Regular Elements $\mathcal{O}_H$

This module establishes the arithmetic and algebraic properties of the bivariate $\Lambda$-weight
on the ring of regular elements $\mathcal{O}_H$ (formalized as `weight_Λ_over_𝒪`). This calculus
supports the inductive weight bounds utilized in [BCIKS20] Appendix A.4 (Hensel lifting
weight induction), which bounds the algebraic complexity of the Hensel numerator sequence
$\beta_t$.

The weight $\Lambda(a)$ for $a \in \mathcal{O}_H$ measures the degree complexity of its canonical
polynomial representative. This module establishes:
- Sub-additivity under addition, subtraction, and finite summation (bounded by the maximum weight).
- Sub-multiplicativity under multiplication and powers (bounded by the sum of weights).
- Base weights for constants and leading coefficient multiples (such as the regular element $W$).
- Monotonicity of the weight with respect to the degree parameter $D$.

The weights take values in $\mathbb{N} \cup \{-\infty\}$ (represented as `WithBot ℕ`), where
$-\infty$ behaves as the additive identity and bottom element under the join.

/-! ### Reduction-invariant rephrasing of the canonical representative

`weight_Λ_over_𝒪 hH a D` is by definition `weight_Λ (canonicalRepOf𝒪 hH a) H D`, and the canonical
representative is the unique `mk`-preimage of `a` of degree `< deg (H_tilde' H)`. The key bridge
already proven in-tree is `weight_Λ_over_𝒪_le_of_mk_eq`: *any* representative bounds the weight.
We use it pervasively. -/

(in fact they are equal by definition); recorded as a `≤` for uniform downstream use. -/

The constants `F[X]` lift into `𝒪 H` as `mk ∘ C`; their weight is bounded by their `F[X]`-degree.
In particular `W = liftToFunctionField H.leadingCoeff` corresponds to the regular element
`mk (C H.leadingCoeff)`, whose weight is `≤ (H.leadingCoeff).natDegree ≤ D - d_H`. -/

`β_0 = T = mk X` in App.-A.4. Its weight is `Λ(X) = 1·(D + 1 − d_H)` (the `Y`-power contribution of

The per-`Y`-power contribution is `D + 1 − natDegreeY H`, monotone non-decreasing in `D` (truncated
subtraction). Hence the whole weight is monotone in `D`. This lets the induction relax `D` upward
when threading the `Λ(W) ≤ D − d_H`, `Λ(ξ) ≤ (d−1)(D − d_H + 1)` budgets. -/
