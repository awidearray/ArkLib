# Proximity-Prize "bits of security" leaderboard (ABF26 §6)

A machine-checked **leaderboard contract** for the soundness of the §6 toy
protocol (Construction 6.2 / its simplified IOR Construction 6.9). The
Ethereum Foundation Proximity Prize (proximityprize.org) asks for the gap
between the *provable* security of small-field hash-based SNARGs and the
*best known attack*; at the KoalaBear-sextic regime (`ρ = 1/2`, `t = 128`)
this is the ≈64-vs-≈116-bit frontier (ABF26 §6.3 Tables 2–5, and the
standalone attack of Fenzi–Sanso, eprint 2025/2197).

This file states that frontier as two opposing Lean structures over **one
common quantity** — the soundness error of the simplified IOR `T'[C]`
(Construction 6.9, the §6.4 attack target), `winningSetSoundness` — so the
scalar gap between them is meaningful:

* `SecurityLowerBound p` — an inhabitant is a proof "we can *prove* `≥ bits`
  bits of security": `soundnessError ≤ 2^(-bits)`. The proof routes through
  the full-protocol round-by-round (RBR) upper bound `toySoundnessError`
  (Lemmas 6.10 / 6.6 / 6.8).
* `SecurityUpperBound p` — an inhabitant is a proof "no analysis can prove
  `> bits` bits": `soundnessError ≥ 2^(-bits)`. The witness is the
  winning-set attack of Lemmas 6.12 / 6.13.
* `securityGap lo hi := hi.bits - lo.bits` — the scalar contestants minimise.
  `SecurityLowerBound.bits_le_of` proves `lo.bits ≤ hi.bits` (so the gap is
  `≥ 0`) directly from the two inequalities, axiom-cleanly.

## The common quantity (central design decision)

The two sides **must** bound the same quantity or the gap is meaningless.
The trap: `toySoundnessError` (the full-protocol RBR max) is an *upper* bound,
while the attack lemmas L6.12/6.13 *lower* bound. So `attack ≤ error ≤
toySoundnessError`. We make the leaderboard quantity the **simplified-IOR
soundness error** `winningSetSoundness` — per `winningSet`'s Definition 6.11,
the worst-case winning-challenge fraction `|Ω|/|F|` over *violating* instances.
This is the object the §6.4 attacks directly lower-bound and Lemma 6.10
upper-bounds.

* the X side proves `soundnessError ≤ toySoundnessError ≤ 2^(-bits)`
  (`toySoundnessError` is the *vehicle*, not the leaderboard quantity);
* the Y side proves `soundnessError ≥ winningSet.ncard/|F| ≥ 2^(-bits)`.

**Why `winningSetSoundness` is `t`-independent (no `(1-δ)^t` term).** `T'[C]`
is single-round; its soundness error is *exactly* the winning fraction. The
spot-check term `(1-δ)^t` belongs to the *full* protocol C6.2, and at the
prize regime (`t=128`, `δ≈1-1/√2`) it equals `2^(-64)` — which alone exceeds
the attack target `2^(-116)`. Folding it into the common quantity would
collapse the attack side to a triviality (and, at a smaller `δ`, make the
provable side a *falsehood*). It therefore lives only in `toySoundnessError`,
where it correctly caps the *provable* security at 64 bits (ABF26 §6.3, `.tex`
2819–2823: the soundness is `max(2^(-71.5), 2^(-64))`, spot-check-dominated).

Stating the upper-bound structure against `soundnessError` (not
`toySoundnessError`) is what keeps the leaderboard faithful: a contestant
cannot "win" by inflating the RBR bound — they must exhibit a real attack.

The Phase-1 grand-challenge framework
(`ProximityGap.GrandChallenges`) feeds the X side: a tighter
`MCALowerWitness` shrinks the `ε_mca` term inside `toySoundnessError`, which
raises the provable lower bound `X`.

/-! ## The soundness scalar (Definition 6.11 reading)

`winningSetSoundness` is the simplified IOR's actual soundness error: the
supremum, over instances `(v, μ₁, μ₂, f₁, f₂)` that *violate* the relaxed
relation `R̃_{C,δ}^2`, of the winning-challenge fraction `|Ω| / |F|`. The
violating constraint is essential — over *all* inputs a valid instance has
`Ω = F` (fraction `1`), so the unrestricted sup is the trivial `1`. -/

/-- **The correlated-agreement attack lower-bounds the simplified-IOR soundness**
(the §6.4.2 attack chain, end-to-end and machine-checked). For a linear code
`C`, the soundness error `winningSetSoundness` is at least the correlated
agreement error `ε_ca(C, δ)`. This is **Lemma 6.13 of [ABF26]**
(`simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`) packaged as a `ViolatingInstance` and pushed through
`winningSetRatio_le_winningSetSoundness`: the attack witness's winning fraction
`|Ω|/|F| ≥ ε_ca` is a genuine lower bound on the worst-case soundness.

This is the real content the §6.3-numeric attack anchors instantiate: a
`SecurityUpperBound` of `b` bits at a code with `ε_ca ≥ 2^(-b)` follows
immediately. **CLOSED (2026-06), axiom-clean** (`#print axioms` = `[propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, no `sorryAx`): the §6.4.1 winning-set construction
is proved end-to-end here (the violation certificate is supplied per word-stack by the
in-tree bridge `relaxedRelation_two_zero_imp_jointProximity`). Only the *numeric*
`ε_ca ≥ 2^(-b)` at the genuine KoalaBear code remains owed downstream
(`fenziSanso_upperBound_attack`), which is a separate coding-theory obligation, not part of this
lemma. -/

/-! ## What the leaderboard quantity is, and is NOT

The common quantity is **`winningSetSoundness`** — the soundness error of the
*simplified IOR* `T'[C]` (Construction 6.9, the §6.4 attack target), per
Definition 6.11. This is the object the §6.4 attacks (Lemmas 6.12/6.13)
*directly* lower-bound and the §6.4 soundness analysis (Lemma 6.10) upper-bounds.

It is deliberately **t-independent**: `T'[C]` is single-round, so its soundness
error is exactly the worst-case winning fraction (no spot-check term). Folding a
`(1-δ)^t` term into this quantity would be unfaithful — it would (i) belong to
the *full* protocol C6.2, not C6.9, and (ii) at the prize regime `t = 128`,
`δ ≈ 1-1/√2`, the spot-check term is `(1/√2)^128 = 2^(-64)`, which alone
exceeds the attack target `2^(-116)` and dominates the provable target
`2^(-64)` — collapsing the attack side to a triviality and the provable side to
a falsehood. The `(1-δ)^t` round lives only in the X-side *vehicle*
`toySoundnessError` (the full-protocol RBR bound, below), where it correctly
caps the *provable* security at 64 bits (ABF26 §6.3, `.tex` lines 2819–2823:
the spot-check term dominates `max(2^(-71.5), 2^(-64))`). -/

/-! ## The RBR upper-bound vehicle (full protocol C6.2; Lemmas 6.6 / 6.8)

`toySoundnessError` reuses the *exact* per-round error terms of
`Spec.General.protocol62_knowledgeSound` / `protocol62_rbrKnowledgeSound`
(Lemmas 6.6 / 6.8): the `γ`-round error `ε_mca(C,δ) + |Λ(C^{≡2},δ)| / |F|` and
the spot-check error `(1-δ)^t`. It upper-bounds `winningSetSoundness` (via
Lemma 6.10, since the `γ`-round error already dominates the simplified IOR's
error) and is the X-side vehicle. -/

/-- The round-by-round soundness upper bound of **Lemmas 6.6 / 6.8 of [ABF26]**
(the *full* protocol C6.2): the `max` of the combination-randomness error
`ε_mca(C,δ) + |Λ(C^{≡2},δ)| / |F|` and the spot-check error `(1-δ)^t`. These are
the *exact* per-round terms of `protocol62_knowledgeSound`. It bounds the
simplified-IOR soundness `winningSetSoundness` from above (X-side vehicle); the
`(1-δ)^t` branch is what caps provable security at 64 bits at the prize regime. -/

STATUS (DISPROVEN + NEEDS_CLASSICAL). This bound is the soundness analysis of
Construction 6.9 (ABF26 Lemma 6.10): `winningSetSoundness ≤ ε_mca + |Λ|/|F|`.
Its `ε_mca` term is the *mutual correlated agreement* error, whose provable
size hinges on the proximity radius `δ` one is allowed to take. The
up-to-capacity reading (correlated-agreement / mutual-correlated-agreement /
list-decodability with `BStar = ρ`) was DISPROVEN in 2025 (Crites–Stewart;
Ben-Sasson–Carmon–Haback–Kopparty–Saraf; Diamond–Gruen;
eprint.iacr.org/2025/2046): it is FALSE for some Reed–Solomon families, so any
placeholder discharged at capacity would be discharging a false statement. The
provable replacement is the Johnson-radius variant (`BStar = √ρ`). Even the
Johnson-radius bound is NEEDS_CLASSICAL: discharging it requires classical
coding-theory results (Johnson bound / Guruswami–Sudan / Reed–Solomon
list-decoding) that are NOT yet in mathlib (no Reed–Solomon, list-decoding, or
Johnson API upstream) — a genuine ground-up formalization, not a port. Do not
attempt to close the sorry; do not remove it. See

/-! ## Parameter record (KoalaBear-sextic regime)

`ToyParams` bundles the ambient field/index and interpreted code (the
universe-pinned bridge — `epsMCA`/`Λ` need their code at `Type 0`) together
with the plain-data numeric regime (KoalaBear field size `q`, sextic
extension, rate `ρ`, and `s, n, k, t, δ, η`). The leaderboard anchor now uses
the genuine KoalaBear-sextic carrier and RS code; the remaining Phase-5
obligations are the code-theoretic cardinality/RBR inequalities recorded below. -/

/-- The KoalaBear-sextic parameter regime plus its code interpretation. The
operational fields `(F, ι, C, δ, t, k)` feed `soundnessError`; the documentary

/-! ## Anchor parameter point and the two current entries

`koalaIRS` fixes the genuine KoalaBear-sextic regime (`q = 2^31 - 2^24 + 1`,
sextic extension, `ρ = 1/2`, `t = 128`) over the concrete rate-`1/2`
Reed-Solomon code `KoalaBear.rsCodeSet`.

The two anchors below are conditional on explicit residual propositions rather than
hidden proof holes. Their remaining obligations are code-theoretic: the §6.3 RBR upper-bound
calculation for the provable side, and the Fenzi-Sanso winning-set construction for the attack
side. The field and code are no longer opaque stand-ins. -/

/-- The Proximity-Prize anchor parameter point: the genuine KoalaBear-sextic regime
(`q = 2^31 - 2^24 + 1`, sextic extension, `ρ = 1/2`, `t = 128`) over the real field
`F_{p^6}` and the genuine rate-`1/2` Reed-Solomon code. The proximity radius is set near capacity,
`δ = 3/10` (just above `1 - 1/√2 ≈ 0.293`), so the full-protocol spot-check term
`(1-δ)^128 ≈ 2^(-65.9) ≤ 2^(-64)` is consistent with the headline 64-bit provable ceiling
(cf. ABF26 §6.3, `.tex` 2819–2823). -/

one actually *prove* for the toy protocol at the KoalaBear-sextic rate regime

is the open research problem the prize poses — it is an unsolved research
problem, not a closeable Lean obligation. The `64`-bit value here is a
placeholder anchor, and the proof route moreover inherits the
DISPROVEN/NEEDS_CLASSICAL status of `winningSetSoundness_le_toySoundnessError`

/-! ## Concrete KoalaBear-sextic carrier

The anchor point `koalaIRS` is the genuine KoalaBear-sextic carrier over the real field
`F_{p^6}` (`KoalaBear.Sextic`, `p = 2^31 - 2^24 + 1`) and the genuine rate-`1/2` Reed-Solomon
code (`KoalaBear.rsCodeSet`, the range of an explicit `F`-linear evaluation encoder). Two things
are concrete, not owed:

* **the field size** — `|F| = p^6 ≈ 2^186` (`KoalaBear.card_sextic`), so the
  prize window `[2^(-116), 2^(-64)]` is genuinely representable; and
* **the code's `F`-linearity** — true *by construction*
  (`KoalaBear.rsCode_isLinear` is `⟨rsEncoder, rfl⟩`), which is exactly the
  `hClin` hypothesis the proven attack chain `epsCA_le_winningSetSoundness`
  requires and the opaque stand-in could not supply.

What remains genuinely owed at the concrete carrier is *only* the §6
code-theoretic content (the size of the attack winning set / the value of
`ε_ca` of the RS code), not field arithmetic or linearity. The numeric anchor
reductions below discharge the **explicit-power arithmetic** end-to-end (sorry-
free, `norm_num` only), turning each owed obligation into a pure coding-theory
fact about a *winning-set cardinality*. -/

arithmetic: `(2 : ℝ≥0) ^ (-(b : ℝ)) = (2 ^ b)⁻¹` for a natural `b`. -/

/-- `(2 : ℝ≥0) ^ (-(b : ℝ)) = ((2 : ℝ≥0) ^ b)⁻¹` for natural `b`: the real
exponent `-(b)` collapses to the reciprocal natural power. The arithmetic core

/-! ### Attack-side numeric reduction (`fenziSanso` ⇒ explicit power)

The proven backbone is `winningSetRatio_le_winningSetSoundness`: any violating
instance's winning fraction `|Ω|/|F|` lower-bounds `winningSetSoundness`. Over
the concrete field `|F| = p^6 ≤ 2^186`, a winning set of `≥ 2^70` challenges
already realises the `2^(-116)` attack floor (`2^70 / 2^186 = 2^(-116)`). This
turns the §6.4 attack obligation into a *single cardinality bound* — the genuine
code-theoretic content — with all field arithmetic discharged here. -/

/-- **Field-general attack floor from a winning-set cardinality bound.** A
violating instance whose winning set has at least `2^(N-b)` challenges, over a
field of size `≤ 2^N`, forces `winningSetSoundness ≥ 2^(-b)` (the `b`-bit attack
floor). Pure NNReal explicit-power arithmetic over the proven backbone
`winningSetRatio_le_winningSetSoundness` (`|Ω|/|F| ≥ 2^(N-b)/2^N = 2^(-b)`). This
is the parameter-general core of the concrete anchor below: it consumes a
winning-set *cardinality* hypothesis (the §6.4 construction's output), it does
not produce one, so it is reusable at any leaderboard parameter point. -/

by construction). `ε_ca(C, δ) ≤ winningSetSoundness C δ` at the concrete
KoalaBear-sextic RS code: this is `epsCA_le_winningSetSoundness` discharged with
the in-tree `δ`-bounds and the by-construction linear-encoder hypothesis
`KoalaBear.rsCode_isLinear` — exactly the `hClin` the opaque stand-in could not
provide. With this, the §6.4 attack obligation at the genuine code is *only* the
numeric `2^(-116) ≤ ε_ca`; the soundness-vehicle step is now a real theorem. -/

cardinality bound on the attack winning set) — the field arithmetic

/-! ### Provable-side numeric reduction (`arklib_lowerBound` ⇒ explicit power)

The provable side routes through the full-protocol RBR vehicle
`toySoundnessError`, whose binding cap at the prize regime is the spot-check
term `(1-δ)^t = (7/10)^128`. The *numeric* obligation
`toySoundnessError ≤ 2^(-64)` reduces to bounding that explicit power; the
remaining `winningSetSoundness ≤ toySoundnessError` step is ABF26 Lemma 6.10,
which is **DISPROVEN/NEEDS_CLASSICAL** (see
`winningSetSoundness_le_toySoundnessError` docstring) and is left as the owed
residual — *not* attempted here. -/

/-- The spot-check branch dominates and is below `2^(-64)`: at `δ = 3/10`,
`t = 128`, the term `(1 - δ)^t = (7/10)^128 ≤ 2^(-64)`. Pure explicit-power
arithmetic over `ℝ≥0` (`(7/10)^128 ≈ 2^(-65.9)`); cross-multiplied to integers
and closed by `norm_num`. This is the binding numeric cap of the provable side. -/
